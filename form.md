Nutrimeters is a digital tool that evaluates the nutritional intake of an individual or a family 
and helps analyze nutritional trends in neighberhoods in order to improve the quality of their 
diet.
```

## What is your solution?

> Describe your solution and how it works in simple terms. What is it? What does it do? What processes and technology does it use?

> Maximum 200 words

```
Nutrimeters assesses nutritional intake through a multiple choice survey, where users complete
their profile (age, weight, height, health conditions), their preferences and their daily dietary
intake. We use this information anonymously, to calculate the nutritional state based on the
provided answers, showing some graphs for easy understanding and suggestions to improve their diet
and/or create a healthy routine.

We plan to collaborate with some stores and supermarkets to include and sell some essential
products to the users diet directly. All the user information will be stored anonymously
(withouth any personal information that could identify / track someone) to have a map with the
general nutrition of the region and/or zone. This data is not available for the users and it will
be only available under permission, it's main purpose is to be used to improve the efficiency of
resources managment for stores and markets near the zone. This will also facilitate the awareness
and study of national nutrition as and together with the INAN (National Institute of Food and
Nutrition)

The Ministry of Health of Paraguay has revealed that there has been an increase of 2.5% in the
prevalence of overweight and obesity in the group of 5 to 19 years. In 2017 there was a percentage
of 32%, and in 2018 it increased to 34.5%, a trend that is increasing.

2 out of 3 adults are overweight or obese (58%), of these, 1 in 4 adults (23%) are obese.
Likewise, the "State of the World's Children 2019: Children, food and nutrition" reveals that at
least 1 in 3 children under the age of five (+200M) is undernourished or overweight. Nearly 2 in 3
children between the ages of six months and two are not getting foods that promote rapid growth in
their bodies and brains.

In 2018 the "Food and Nutrition Surveillance System" describes: malnutrition, hidden hunger,
caused by a lack of essential nutrients, and overweight among children under 5 years of age,
while notes that throughout the world:

 - 3 out of 10 children are overweight.
 - 11.4% of children suffer from chronic malnutrition.
 - 3 out of 10 schoolchildren are overweight.
 - 149 million children are stunted, or too young for their age,
 - 50 million children are wasted, or are too thin for their height,
 - 340 million children (1 in 2) suffer from deficiencies of vitamins and essential nutrients,
 - 40 million children are overweight or obese.

And almost half of the country's pregnant women are overweight and of these, 1 in 3 is obese.

## Who does your solution serve? In what ways will the solution impact their lives?

The utilization of this tool benefits to everyone, and it could be used globally. Obesity and
anorexia can be prevented by leading a healthy lifestyle. The lifestyle of people has a significant
impact on their health, so that the adoption of a good diet contributes to a better state of both
physical and psychological health and a better quality of life.

Many times the lack of knowledge, awareness or even the confusion related to a correct diet
causes people to not have an adequate diet.

Therefore, with this tool, food intake can be evaluated in schools, institutions and in people's
private lives to improve their nutrition and have a healthy live.

In this way, healthy diets can be planned with the necessary foods and supplements without much
effort.

While stores and supermarkets can sell and access food needs in an smart way, this will also
facilitate the awareness and study of national nutrition as and together with the INAN
(National Institute of Food and Nutrition).

## What steps have you taken to understand the needs of the population you want to serve?

> Have you done research with potential users? Have you volunteered or worked with an existing organization working on this problem? Have you engaged potential users in the design and development of your solution?

We investigate the current situation that the country and even various parts of the globe are
facing as far as nutrition is concerned, we also study the different diets and research, such as
RDI (Reference Daily Intake), DRI (Dietary Reference Intake), RDA (Recommended Dietary Allowances),
FDA (Food and Drug Administration), the SACN (Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition),
the Government Dietary Recommendations from UK, etc.

At the beginning we plan to operate with the community, public institutions, congresses
and with the government.

The team has some experience in the field, some of the members were interns on Morfit, a nutritional
tracker that allows you to keep track of your food receiving personalized and dynamic targets based
on goals.

At the moment we have almost finished the development plan. And we are preparing ourselves for
the build phase to deploy ourselves.

## Describe the core technology that powers your solution.

> Every successful Solv[ED] solution must include technology—whether new or existing—as a key component. If your solution is a new technology or a new application of an existing technology, describe the technology and how it is used. If your solution is a new project or business, describe how it relies on technology to function. We define technology broadly—it could be hardware or software, digital or manufactured, advanced or low-tech, brand new or traditional/ancestral. (We have selected solutions that involve drones, AI, blockchain, seed technology, ancestral irrigation methods, biodegradable banana fiber sanitary pads, and more.)
